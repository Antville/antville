...to run Antville on your computer<sup>1</sup> with least effort, that is: [webserver](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty), [application server](http://helma.org), [embedded database](http://www.h2database.com) and of course the Antville code, already pre-configured.

Supposing you have a Java Runtime Environment installed, you just need to:

  * [Download](http://code.google.com/p/antville/downloads/list) the package _(<6 MB!)_
  * Unzip it
  * Start it â€“ either by clicking `start.bat` on a Windows machine or `start.sh` on Linux and Mac OS X
  * Point your browser to http://localhost:8080.

You should see the typical Antville start page where you need to register a primal user account to gain system administration rights to your AntClick installation.

(To stop AntClick, simply close the terminal window.)

We warmly welcome your feedback! Please let us know what you think of the software
