# Welcome to the Antville Project #

Antville is a high performance, full featured weblog hosting software based on [Helma Object Publisher](http://helma.org), an open source web application server entirely written in Java. Antville itself is written in JavaScript and scales very well up to several thousands of weblogs. It is very easy to use while offering a lot of advanced features that make it even capable of hosting other types of websites.

## Activity Log ##

**12 March 2015** So we are going to [move away](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.at/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) our code from this site, obviously… Sooner or later this year, I estimate.

**27 June 2014** We migrated the source code repository here at Google Code from Subversion to Git. After trying out [Git’s own SVN conversion tool](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html) as well as [Git2SVN](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) and experiencing some issues with revisions 700—866, 3769 and 3770 we did not get any errors with a tool called [SubGit](http://subgit.com) – which does not have to mean the issues are really resolved but it provided the easiest approach and the most appealing result.

**3 August 2013** Version 1.4 was just released today! It’s a tiny update but nevertheless a big improvement. As usual, you find all the packages in the [download section](http://code.google.com/p/antville/downloads).

**27 June 2011** Release packages of version 1.3 of Antville and AntClick have arrived in the [download section](http://code.google.com/p/antville/downloads)! Get ’em while they’re hot!

**26 June 2011** To catch up with the latest trends in collaborative software development the Subversion repository of Antville here at Google Code is now mirrorred at [GitHub](https://github.com/p3k/antville). Fork on!

**4 June 2011** With the advent of the beta version of 1.3 over at [Antville.org](http://antville.org) it is now possible to login using third-party authentication services like Facebook, Google and Twitter. To emphasize this nifty new feature you now can follow Antville on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/Antville) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/antville_org).

**20 January 2011** Another year, another (bugfix) version: fresh from the trunk, here is [version 1.2.1](http://code.google.com/p/antville/wiki/ChangeLog#Release_1.2.1) of Antville and of course AntClick, as usual available from the [download](http://code.google.com/p/antville/download) section.

**18 June 2010** It’s the ninth birthday of Antville – and the release date of the final [version 1.2](ChangeLog#Release_1.2.md) of the weblog software! Celebrate with us and don’t miss to take a look at the packages in the [download](http://code.google.com/p/antville/downloads) section. I really recommend to try out the AntClick package. It is the best one so far.

**June 2010** Approaching a final release I just added the release candidate packages of version 1.2 for both, Antville and AntClick, to the download section.

**April 2010** AntClick 1.2 has gone beta and is available for download! Get it while it’s hot – it has got some brand-new features like comment muting or importing/exporting site data.

**January 2010** Happy New Year! It should be a good one: internationalization is making huge steps forward, AntClick has been woken up from a long time of hibernation and the latest spam attacks on Antville.org have stimulated some thoughts about countermeasures.

**October 2009** Finally: The [API documentation](http://antville.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/index.html) is back!

**August 2009** Antville is now also a [registered association](http://about.antville.org/stories/1938901/) as “Verein für Entwicklung, Betrieb und Unterstützung freier Publishing-Software” _(”association for development, maintainence and support of free publishing software”)_ in the Austrian register of associations. Please join the club, become a member and support the project with your donation!

**February 2009** Antville.org moved to a new server called [Minnegard](http://about.antville.org/stories/1878781/).

**May 2008** First public installation of revised code as Antville version 1.2 at [Antville.org](http://tobi.antville.org/stories/1792576/).

**October 2007** I am trying to get some more financial support for Antville via this year's second [netznetz.net poll for municipal aid](http://www.netznetz.net/wiki/Projekt_Antville_2007-2) (in german).

**August 2007** Happily coding :)

**June 2007** The meteorologic summer has just begun recently while the astronomical one is still far ahead and yet here we are amidst the [Antville Summer Of Code 2007](http://tobi.antville.org/stories/1634995/). So enjoy the warmth of early sunshine and maybe you can [spend a dime or two](http://tobi.antville.org/stories/1636158/) to support the further development of the wonderful weblog software.

A detailed [roadmap](Roadmap.md) about envisioned future Antville releases is in the works.
